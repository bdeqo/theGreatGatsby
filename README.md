# Gastby Bootcamp with [Andrew Mead](http://mead.io)

Slightly improved version of [Gatsby JS - The Great Gatsby Bootcamp [Full Tutorial]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM)

## What's Different

- Displays both markdown and Contentful posts at the same time
- Helmet location: page titles are passed through the `Layout` component
- 

To run the application:

    $ npm start

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).
